# A Decentralized and Tamper-Proof Data Layer for the World

*A Bitcoin-Inspired Version of Google Maps as a Public Good*

In an era where our understanding of the world—our surroundings, places across the globe—increasingly comes from digital "second layers" like Google Maps, the information provided by these platforms plays a pivotal role in shaping our decisions in society, security, politics or public health. Just as Bitcoin revolutionized currency by making it a decentralized public good, there's a pressing need for a decentralized and tamper-proof version of this second layer of the world. Such a platform would host critical information about the Earth's surface, serving humanity's best interests.

This project proposes an architecture where the Internet Computer plays a central role. The React app showcased here, developed within the time and resource constraints (my first react app, started developing app May 2023) of this hackathon, serves as a preliminary and illustrative implementation of a use case (users interacting with the data layer through smartphones).
